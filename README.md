### :key: Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file

`client_id`

`client_secret`

These two values are needed to access Reddit’s API as a script application. If you don’t already have a client ID and client secret, follow Reddit’s <a href="https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/OAuth2-Quick-Start-Example#first-steps">First Steps Guide</a> to create them.
